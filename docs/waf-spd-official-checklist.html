        expertise in specific AWS services. This AWS Service Delivery Validation Checklist outlines the criteria necessary to achieve
        the AWS WAF designation under the AWS Service Delivery Program.</p>

            <h2 class="section--title">Expectations of Parties</h2>
            <div class="section--content"><p>It is expected that AWS Partners will review this document in detail before submitting an AWS Service Delivery Program application, even if AWS Partners believe that all pre-requisites are met. If items in this document are unclear AWS Partners should contact their Partner Development Representative (PDR) or Partner Development Manager (PDM). AWS reserves the right to make changes to this document at any time.</p>
        <p>When ready to submit a program application, AWS Partners must complete the self-assessment spreadsheet available for download at the top of this page. Upon completion of the self-assessment spreadsheet, AWS Partners must submit an application in AWS Partner Central. For more information on how to submit an application, view the <a href="https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/ContentFolderPartner?id=0698a00000BpB2yAAF">Program Guide</a> or contact your PDR or PDM.</p>
        <p>Once an AWS Partner’s application has been submitted through the AWS Partner Central, AWS will review for completeness and for compliance with the requirements. AWS will review and aim to respond back with any questions within five business days. Incomplete applications will not be considered until all requirements are met. If complete, AWS will send the application to in-house experts to complete a Technical Validation.</p>
        <p>The Technical Validation will be completed offline. AWS Partners should prepare for the Technical Validation by reading the Checklist, completing and submitting a self-assessment for each Case Study, and submitting all relevant objective evidence with the application, including architecture diagrams.</p>
        <p>Upon completion of the Technical Validation, AWS Partners will receive a final status for the submitted application either confirming or denying acceptance into the AWS Service Delivery Program. AWS Partners may attain one or more AWS Service Delivery designations. Please note that attaining one AWS Service Delivery designation does not guarantee approval into additional AWS Service Delivery designations. If the AWS Partner is denied acceptance for the desired AWS Service Delivery designation, the AWS Partner may re-apply via AWS Partner Central after the AWS Partner has remediated all outstanding action items.</p>
        <p>AWS may revoke an AWS Partner’s AWS Service Delivery designation if, at any time, AWS determines in its sole discretion that such AWS Partner does not meet its AWS Service Delivery Program requirements. If an AWS Partner’s AWS Service Delivery designation is revoked, such AWS Partner will (i) no longer receive benefits associated with its designation, (ii) immediately cease use of all materials provided to it in connection with the applicable AWS Service Delivery designation and (iii) immediately cease to identify or hold itself out as a Partner of such AWS Service Delivery.</p>

                                        <p>AWS Partner must privately share with AWS details about two (2) unique examples of AWS WAF projects executed for two (2) unique AWS customers. Each case study must demonstrate how the Partner used the unique capabilities of the AWS service to address the customer's problem.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the required case study details provided in AWS Partner Central, the partner must also
                            provide architecture diagrams of the specific customer deployment and information listed in the technical requirements sections of this validation checklist.</p>
                            <p>The information provided for these case studies will be used by AWS for validation purposes only. AWS Partner is not required to publish these details publicly.</p>
                            <p>AWS Partner can reuse the same case study across different AWS Specialization designations as long as the case study and implementation scope are relevant to those designations. The partner should make
                            sure the existing case study clearly explains the relevance to each designation they are applying for.</p>
                            <p>In cases where a case study is used across multiple AWS Partner Specialization applications, the partner must attach a completed self-assessment spreadsheet for each Specialization with all service-specific details provided.</p>
                            <p>AWS will accept one case study per customer. Each customer must be a separate legal entity to qualify. The partner may use an example for an internal or affiliate company of the partner if the offering is available to outside customers.</p>
                            <p>All case studies must describe deployments that have been performed within the past 18 months and must be for projects that are in production with customers, rather than in a ‘pilot’ or proof of concept stage.</p>
                            <p>All case studies provided will be examined in the Documentation Review of the Technical Validation. The partner offering will be removed from consideration if the partner cannot provide the documentation necessary to assess all case studies against each relevant validation checklist item, or if any of the validation checklist items are not met.</p>
                            <p>Note: Public-facing case studies are encouraged over private case studies, as they may be used by AWS for marketing purposes and will be featured in <a href="https://partners.amazonaws.com/">Partner Solution Finder</a>. Evidence of a publicly referenceable case study must be provided in the form of a case study, white paper, blog post, or equivalent.
                            In cases where the partner cannot publicly name customers due to the sensitive nature of the customer engagements, the partner may choose to anonymize the public case study. Anonymized public case study details will be published by AWS, but the customer name will remain private. For best practices on how to write an accepted public case study see the <a href="https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/partnercentral2/s/resources?Id=0698W00000wgPO9QAM">Public Case Study Guide</a>.</p>
